Introduction to STL
Library of Generic classes and function

Why use STL?
Well tested components
Time saving

Components of STL?
1. Container        -->   Object which stores data
i. Sequence container - store data in linear fashion - vector, list, dequeue
ii. Associative container - Direct(fast) access - tree, set, multiset, map, multimap
iii. Derived container - Real world modeling - stack, queue, priority-queue

2. Algorithms       -->   Procedure to process data
3. Iterators        -->   Object which points to an element of a container

When to use which?
Sequence Container
1. vector - Random access - fast
          - Insertion | deletion in middle - slow
          - Insertion at the end - fast

2. List - Random access - slow
        - Insertion in middle - fast
        - Insertion | deletion at the end - fast

Associative container --> All operations fast except Random access

Derived container --> Depends --> data structure
